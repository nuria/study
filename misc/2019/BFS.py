"""
Calculate distance in an eually weighted graph

The first line contains an integer , the number of queries. Each of the following  sets of lines has the following format:

The first line contains two space-separated integers  and , the number of nodes and edges in the graph.
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers,  and , describing an edge connecting node  to node .
The last line contains a single integer, , denoting the index of the starting node.

For each of the  queries, print a single line of  space-separated integers denoting the shortest distances to each of the  other nodes from starting position . These distances should be listed sequentially by node number (i.e., ), but should not include node . If some node is unreachable from , print  as the distance to that node.

Input:
2
4 2
1 2
1 3
1
3 1
2 3
2

Output:
6 6 -1
-1 6
